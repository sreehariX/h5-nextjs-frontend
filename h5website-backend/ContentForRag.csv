H5 Enhancement Project
Completion Report
IIT Bombay Alumni Association

1
It is my pleasure and privilege to report the successful completion of the H5 Enhancement Project. A pioneering project at IITB conceived, funded, and executed by the alumni of H5. A powerful testimonial to the transformative power of the time, talent, and treasure donated by alumni to the alma mater.
This report is dedicated to the memory of Speedy (G. Kumar, C’77,). He initiated the project in 2019. His impeccable choice of invitees for the first meeting brought together the core project team.
Genesis
Abhijit Gadgil (C’77,) visited the campus on Foundation Day 2019 and posted pictures of the hostel in a WhatsApp group. The appalling state of the hostel resulted in a huge hue and cry that something had to be done. Speedy organized a meeting of H5 alumni from the 70s and 80s and Project H5 Enhancement began.
Ajit Jawle (C’77) visited the hostel, talked to the students, and developed an eminently feasible plan, which would improve the quality of life in the hostel – a tower in each of the three wings of the hostel which would effectively double the number of showers and toilets on every floor of every wing of the hostel, and two modern study rooms in the open spaces between the wings. The estimated cost of the project was Rs. 3.5 crores.
2
I, then Chairman IITBAA, approached Prof. Suhas Joshi, then Dean, ACR with a request to allow the alumni of H5 to raise funds for and execute the project. The Institute, after due consideration, graciously agreed.
Governance
An MoU was signed between the IITBAA and the Institute. In essence, IITBAA would raise funds in partnership with IITBHF and enter into all contracts and issue corresponding purchase orders for the implementation of the proposed plan. Excess funds, if any, would be used for the structural rehabilitation of the hostel. On behalf of the Institute Dean ACR and Dean IPS, or their nominees, would oversee the project.
An MoU was also signed between IITBAA, Knexir Consultants (Ajit Jawle) responsible for design, SMC Infrastructure (Suhas Mehta, C’83) responsible for construction, and a representative of H5 alumni (Raja Deshpande C’77) delineating roles and responsibilities.
All contract negotiations, including pricing were spearheaded by Knexir Consultants. An independent auditor was contracted on behalf of the AA to inspect and certify the work was done in accordance with the contract prior to payment of invoices. Thus, industry standard practices were followed in the implementation of all aspects of the project.
Fundraising
Shortly after the signing of the MoUs in March 2020 the pandemic struck and everything ground to a halt. In October 2020, the students’ council of the hostel approached Ajit Jawle wanting to know the status of the proposed project. A fund raising team of Ajit Jawle, Anil Kshirsagar, Abhijit Gadgil, Dhananjay Saheba, G. Kumar (Speedy), Milind Dhupkar, Raja Deshpande, Rajeev Deshpande, Shashank Kulkarni, Sreedhar Kona, Suhas Mehta, Vinay Karle, Uday Nadkarni, et al sprang into action. An email campaign was launched and virtual meetings were held with several classes. Most importantly, Suhas Mehta committed to completing the project even if funds were not collected in time. The first contribution came on Nov. 14, 2020, from Vinay Karle (C’96, President IITBHF) and the floodgates opened. Over the next roughly four months, there were a total of 102 donations in the US and 60 donations in India. The eldest donor was from the Class of 1964 and the youngest of the Class of 2019.
On Foundation Day 2021, Suhas Mehta and I had the privilege of presenting the Institute a ceremonial cheque and the project was off and running.
A list of the donors is shown in Attachment 1 (in alphabetical order by first name, the count of donors does not match the number of donations since a few donors made multiple donations).

Project Implementation
Once the funding was secured, BMC permissions for the planned work were secured. The implementation of the design developed by Knexir started in June 2021. The pandemic provided one blessing – there were no students in the hostel during the construction.
The construction of the toilet blocks and two study rooms was undertaken by SMC Infrastructure (Suhas Mehta). The air conditioning and communications networking were handled by Nandkishore Nemade (C’82).
Along the way, not surprisingly, there were a few glitches. A memorable one - there is a peru (guava) tree behind the middle wing of the hostel, which would have had to be removed to be able to put up the associated toilet block. The circumference of the trunk put it in a class where it could not be touched without permission from the BMC. The team came up with a simple and effective solution – rotate the toilet block by 90o! The toilet block was redesigned, approvals were obtained from the BMC, and the project continued. The peru tree is thriving, adds wonderful character to the hostel, and is a great example of preservation of the environment!
Nitin Doshi (C’79) specialising in structural restoration stepped forward to lead the structural rehabilitation of the hostel. Golden Civil, a company Nitin has worked with and recommended, was assigned the repair work of the hostel with negotiated rates for various aspects. The work was completed within budget.
In July 2022, the hostel was handed over to the Institute and once again populated with students.
There were still significant funds left over and additional improvements were undertaken. The play areas were improved with a basketball court and a cricket pitch. An existing, dilapidated study room was refurbished and a room above was refurbished and turned into a practice area for cultural activities. These common areas were also decorated with photographs submitted by alumni across the Institute: Chandrashekhar Sardesai (DhandaNot) (H6,

C’84,), Nikhil Gurjar (H6/H8, C’97), Kiran R. Ambardekar (H8, C’84), and me.
Funds Utilization
Funds have been utilized as follows (all numbers are in INR):

Conclusion
The Institute recognized the significant value of the project by conferring the Distinguished Service Award to Ajit Jawle, Suhas Mehta, Nitin Doshi, and Nandkishore Nemade.
The success of the project gave the impetus to the Institute, IITBAA, and IITBHF to launch Project Evergreen – a world-class complex of three hostels, two for men and one for women, housing over 1100 students at an estimated cost of nearly Rs. 200 crore.
On behalf of Team H5 Enhancement Project, a big thank you to
·
The Institute – the Director, Deputy Directors, Deans, faculty, the Estate Office, and IIT-B DRF for their wholehearted support.
·
IITBAA and IITBHF for their unstinting support – fundraising, legal, admin, …
·
The numerous alumni of H5 for their amazing support with their time, talent, and treasure.
·
The current residents – future alumni – of H5 who have made all our efforts worthwhile!
It is rumoured that H5 has become a spa with students of other hostels visiting to use the showers! On a more serious note, students have appreciated the study rooms and opined that such study rooms should be there in every hostel.
On a recent visit to Project Evergreen, Nandan Nilekani remarked that the paradigm for building infrastructure at the Institute has changed.
Please spread the word among your fellow alumni to support Project Evergreen!
